# NetStocker

Starting with ASP.NET Core can be quite tedious. Using my blog at [jordydeweer.net](https://jordydeweer.net), I want to make this step easier for others.

## Contributing

If you find any bugs in the project, please feel free to open issues. Though, I am not going to accept Pull Requests.

I made that decision, since this application is a sample app. It isn't meant for production environments, nor will I ever recommend using this app. However, if you like how it is built, feel free to fork this repository and make your own application out of it.
